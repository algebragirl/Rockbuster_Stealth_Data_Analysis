# **Rockbuster_Stealth_Data_Analysis**
## **Summary**
I have been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for their new online video service.
My first task is to load all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS).
Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any impromptu business questions that other departments may have.

## **Key Questions & Objectives**
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions, and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they'd like to answer:
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## **Systems used**
-pgAdmin4: Graphical user interface for PostgreSQL used to manage the PostgreSQL database managemnt system and execute queries using SQL

-PostgreSQL: Relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and query Rockbuster's data.
-Tableau Public: Platform for creating and sharing interactive data visualizations
